# Introduction 
It is of interest to have a software application that gives the user the ability of listing measured data depending on certain parameters, like measurement date, system identification, installation configuration, parameter configurations and user defined comments. It should be possible to filter and
select any data of interest, and then view the results of the selected data. Comparison of the
measurement data should also be possible. Different types of plots should be possible to select,
depending on if the data is in frequency domain or time domain.
